# prdctr-common

Shared TypeScript/Subsquid platform packages for the Predictor Foundation.
Any TypeScript project - Subsquid or not - can pull in the dev-tooling
bundle in three lines and inherit the family's conventions for free.

## Packages

Packages live under `packages/<group>/<package>`, grouped by the layer they
serve. Consumers install by package name (`@prdctr-foundation/<name>`); the
folder grouping is for humans, not resolution.

### `tooling/` - shared build, lint & test setup (dev dependencies)

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`tsconfig`](packages/tooling/tsconfig) | Shared `tsconfig` presets (`base`, `node`, `subsquid`, `react`) |
| [`biome-config`](packages/tooling/biome-config) | Shared Biome lint + format config with the Biome version pinned |
| [`git-hooks`](packages/tooling/git-hooks) | Husky-based pre-commit gate: format → lint → typecheck → audit |
| [`e2e`](packages/tooling/e2e) | Zero-setup Playwright harness: config factory + server orchestration |

### `chain/` - Substrate / polkadot-api client (runtime)

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`substrate-primitives`](packages/chain/substrate-primitives) | Branded, validated SS58 address + non-negative Planck balance |
| [`substrate-signer`](packages/chain/substrate-signer) | sr25519 key derivation (`parseSuri`/`deriveKeypair`) + address helpers |
| [`scale`](packages/chain/scale) | Minimal, dependency-free SCALE codec helpers |
| [`chain-errors`](packages/chain/chain-errors) | Chain-boundary error taxonomy + retry/backoff |
| [`papi-chain`](packages/chain/papi-chain) | Descriptor-generic polkadot-api chain boundary (connect / read / submit) |
| [`node-manager`](packages/chain/node-manager) | Client-side contracts for the node-manager pallet (heartbeat payload) |
| [`network-constants`](packages/chain/network-constants) | Single source of truth for network coordinates (prefix, decimals, symbol, endpoints) |

### `indexer/` - Subsquid

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`squid-common`](packages/indexer/squid-common) | Env parsing, SS58 codec, account upsert, entity cache, processor builder, id families, branded primitives |

### `service/` - long-lived Node services (daemons, HTTP APIs)

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`logger`](packages/service/logger) | Tiny dependency-free structured JSON-lines logger |
| [`env`](packages/service/env) | Zod-based environment parsing primitives (fail-fast) |
| [`service-runtime`](packages/service/service-runtime) | Health state machine, k8s probe routes, tick loop, graceful shutdown |

### `web/` - frontend

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`design-system`](packages/web/design-system) | Shared PRDCTR Material-UI theme + design tokens |
| [`ui`](packages/web/ui) | App-agnostic React components + pure utils (address/amount/date/string), per-component subpath imports |
| [`graphql-client`](packages/web/graphql-client) | Framework-light GraphQL-over-HTTP client + React data hooks (`/react` subpath) |

## Quick start (consumer repo)

```bash
# 1. Add .npmrc at repo root (copy from .npmrc.example here)
cat > .npmrc <<'EOF'
@prdctr-foundation:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${GITHUB_TOKEN}
EOF

# 2. Install the dev bundle
pnpm add -D \
  @prdctr-foundation/tsconfig \
  @prdctr-foundation/biome-config \
  @prdctr-foundation/git-hooks \
  typescript
```

Then drop in three small config files:

```json
// package.json (relevant fields)
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "biome check .",
    "prepare": "predictor-git-hooks install"
  }
}
```

```json
// tsconfig.json
{ "extends": "@prdctr-foundation/tsconfig/node" }
```

```json
// biome.json
{ "extends": ["@prdctr-foundation/biome-config/base"] }
```

Subsquid repos extend `@prdctr-foundation/tsconfig/subsquid` and
`@prdctr-foundation/biome-config/subsquid` instead, and add
`@prdctr-foundation/squid-common` as a runtime dep.

## Keeping dependencies current

This repo publishes the Renovate preset every service repo extends. Drop a
`renovate.json` at the consumer's root:

```json
{
	"$schema": "https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json",
	"extends": ["local>PRDCTR-Foundation/prdctr-common"]
}
```

That is the whole adoption. The preset is `default.json` here, and it sets the
schedule, the grouping, the supply-chain cooldown and the commit shape - a
consumer overriding any of it should do so in its own file rather than by
forking the preset.

Two things it is deliberately opinionated about. Nothing automerges and nothing
ignores tests, because dependency bumps landing unreviewed is how a repo with
thin CI breaks quietly. And Renovate's own PRs are titled `chore(deps): ...` so
they pass the same `pr-title` gate as everyone else's, which means `deps` has to
stay in each repo's allowed scopes.

`local>` rather than `github>` because this repo is private: the local form
reuses the platform token Renovate already has, where the github form would need
credentials of its own.

Renovate needs the GitHub App installed on the org with access to each repo;
until it is, the config is inert.

## Repo conventions

- **Commit messages:** [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
  Scope is the affected package (e.g. `fix(tsconfig):`, `feat(squid-common):`).
- **Releases:** [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please)
  in manifest mode. Each PR's conventional-commit scope drives which
  package(s) bump on the next release.
- **Lint/format:** Biome, dogfood-extending `@prdctr-foundation/biome-config/base`.
- **TypeScript:** dogfood-extending `@prdctr-foundation/tsconfig/base`.
- **Dependency versions:** shared third-party versions (`typescript`, `@types/node`,
  `polkadot-api`, `@polkadot-*`, `zod`) live in the `catalog:` block of
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. Every package references `catalog:` instead of a literal
  range, so a version can never drift between packages. `scripts/check-catalog.mjs`
  (run as `pnpm lint:catalog`) fails if any cataloged dep uses a literal range.
- **Supply-chain cooldown:** a third-party version must be public for 24h
  (`minimumReleaseAge`) before it can install, and no dependency may run install
  lifecycle scripts unless listed in `onlyBuiltDependencies` (empty by default).
  Our own `@prdctr-foundation/*` scope is excluded from the cooldown. Requires
  pnpm 10 (pinned via `packageManager`).

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm -r build
pnpm -r run typecheck   # also `pnpm -r run types:check`
pnpm -r run test        # unit tests run TypeScript directly (Node >= 22.6)
pnpm lint
pnpm lint:catalog       # catalog-consistency check
```

CI runs the same build → typecheck → test → lint → catalog steps on Node 24.
Published libraries still target `node >=20` (they ship compiled JS).
